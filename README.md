# DSML_project

#### As far as work sharing is concerned, we have always worked together in an equitable way. We (Sybille & Thanusya) coded together on the EPFL computers to have a reasonably powerful computer. Yanis, who joined the project later, showed a lot of enthusiasm and willingness to understand our code. He contributed by taking care of the layout of the notebook, the context/introduction part and the editing of the video.

#### Thank you for everything and we wish you a wonderful end of year! 
##### Sybille Roemer, Thanusya Thambirajah & Yanis Cuche
